            Let's Get Started</h1>
	<p>In this section, we will study some interesting facts about different planets.</p>
	<div class="Mercury">
		<div class="Planet_image">

			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>MERCURY</h1>
				<p>Mercury is the smallest and fastest planet in the solar system.
                                   It is also the closest planet to the sun.
				   It is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury, the fastest Roman god. That is how it got its name.
				   The planet Mercury was known by ancient people thousands of years ago. </p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Venus.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>VENUS</h1>	
				<p>Named after the ancient Roman goddess of beauty, Venus is known for its exceptional brightness.
                                   Find out about the volcanoes that dot Venus's surface, the storms that rage in its atmosphere, 
				   and the surprising feature that makes Venus outshine every planet or star in the night sky.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Earth.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>EARTH</h1>	
				<p>The name Earth is an English/German name which simply means the ground.
                                   Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun.
                                   Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
                                   Earth is not flat, but it's not perfectly round either.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Mars.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>MARS</h1>	
                                <p>Named after the Roman God of war, Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system.
                                   Mars is also known as the 'Red Planet' because, well, it's red! 
                                  This signature colour comes from the large amount of a chemical. The atmosphere on Mars is mostly made of carbon dioxide.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Jupiter.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>JUPITER</h1>
				<p>Jupiter is known for its stripes and large red spot. 
                                   The Galileo spacecraft took this photo of Jupiter's Great Red Spot in 1996. 
				   Jupiter's four largest moons are known as the Galilean satellites because they were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
                                   Jupiter Cannot Become A Star.</p>

		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Saturn.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>SATURN</h1>	
				<p>Saturn is a gas giant made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
                                   Saturn's volume is greater than 760 Earths, and it is the second most massive planet in the solar system, about 95 times Earth's mass.
				   The Ringed Planet is the least dense of all the planets, and is one less dense than water.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Uranus.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>URANUS</h1>	
				<p>Unlike the other planets of the solar system, Uranus is tilted so far that it essentially orbits the sun on its side, with the axis of its spin nearly pointing at the star.
                                   This unusual orientation might be due to a collision with a planet-size body, or several small bodies, after it was formed.</p>	
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Neptune.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>Neptune</h1>
				<p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and last of the known planets. 
                                   While it is the third largest planet with respect to mass, it is only the fourth largest in terms of diameter. 
	                           Due to its blue coloration, Neptune was named after the Roman god of the Sea.
				   It is the Most Distant Planet. </p>	
			</div>

		<div class="Planet_image">
			<img src="Images/Pluto.jpg">
			<div class="Outline_color">
				<h1>PLUTO</h1>	
				<p>Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
                                   It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. 
				   Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun.</p>

<section class="Galaxies">
	<h1>Galaxies</h1>
	<p>In this section, we will study interesting facts about galaxies.</p> 
</section>

<section class="Galaxy_Row">
		<div class="Galaxy_Content">
			<h1>Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
			<p>The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula, is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way. 
			   The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Galaxy_Content">
			<h1>Milky Way</h1>
			<p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. 
			   The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle". From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Galaxy_Content">
			<h1>Triangulum Galaxy</h1>
			<p>The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. The Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye.
                           The galaxy is the smallest spiral galaxy in the Local Group (although the smaller Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may have been spirals before their encounters with the Milky Way).</p>
		</div>
</section>

<section class="Galaxy_Row_1">
		<div class="Galaxy_Content_1">
			<h1>Cygnus A</h1>
			<p>Cygnus A (3C 405) is a radio galaxy, and one of the strongest radio sources in the sky. It was discovered by Grote Reber in 1939. In 1951, Cygnus A, along with Cassiopeia A, and Puppis A were the first "radio stars" identified with an optical source. 
			   Of these, Cygnus A became the first radio galaxy; the other two being nebulae inside the Milky Way. In 1953 Roger Jennison and M K Das Gupta showed it to be a double source. Like all radio galaxies, it contains an active galactic nucleus. In 2016, a radio transient was discovered 460 parsecs away from the center of Cygnus A. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="Galaxy_Content_1">
			<h1>Virgo Cluster</h1>
			<p>The Virgo Cluster is a large cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 Mly away in the constellation Virgo. Comprising approximately 1300 (and possibly up to 2000) member galaxies, the cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group (containing our Milky Way galaxy) is a member. The Local Group actually experiences the mass of the Virgo Supercluster as the Virgocentric flow. It is estimated that the Virgo Cluster's mass is 1.2×1015 M☉ out to 8 degrees of the cluster's center or a radius of about 2.2 Mpc.
			   </p>
		</div>
		<div class="Galaxy_Content_1">
			<h1>Magellanic Clouds</h1>
			<p>The Magellanic Clouds (or Nubeculae Magellani) are two irregular dwarf galaxies visible in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere; they are members of the Local Group and are orbiting the Milky Way galaxy. Because both show signs of a bar structure, they are often reclassified as Magellanic spiral galaxies. The two galaxies are:
			   Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), approximately 163,000 light-years away. Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), approximately 206,000 light years away. </p>
